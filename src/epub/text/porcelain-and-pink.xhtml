			<p>
				<i>A room in the down-stairs of a summer cottage. High around the wall runs an art frieze of a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and a ship on a crimson ocean, a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and a ship on a crimson ocean, a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and so on. In one place on the frieze there is an overlapping—here we have half a fisherman with half a pile of nets at his foot, crowded damply against half a ship on half a crimson ocean. The frieze is not in the plot, but frankly it fascinates me. I could continue indefinitely, but I am distracted by one of the two objects in the room—a blue porcelain bath-tub. It has character, this bath-tub. It is not one of the new racing bodies, but is small with a high tonneau and looks as if it were going to jump; discouraged, however, by the shortness of its legs, it has submitted to its environment and to its coat of sky-blue paint. But it grumpily refuses to allow any patron completely to stretch his legs—which brings us neatly to the second object in the room:</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>It is a girl—clearly an appendage to the bath-tub, only her head and throat—beautiful girls have throats instead of necks—and a suggestion of shoulder appearing above the side. For the first ten minutes of the play the audience is engrossed in wondering if she really is playing the game fairly and hasn’t any clothes on or whether it is being cheated and she is dressed.</i>
			</p>
			<p><i>The girl’s name is</i> <span class="smcap">Julie Marvis</span>. <i>From the proud way she sits up in the bath-tub we deduce that she is not very tall and that she carries herself well. When she smiles, her upper lip rolls a little and reminds you of an Easter Bunny. She is within whispering distance of twenty years old.</i></p>
			<p>
				<i>One thing more—above and to the right of the bath-tub is a window. It is narrow and has a wide sill; it lets in much sunshine, but effectually prevents any one who looks in from seeing the bath-tub. You begin to suspect the plot?</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>We open, conventionally enough, with a song, but, as the startled gasp of the audience quite drowns out the first half, we will give only the last of it:</i>
			</p>

			<p>(<i>During the wild applause that follows</i> <span class="smcap">Julie</span> <i>modestly moves her arms and makes waves on the surface of the water—at least we suppose she does. Then the door on the left opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Lois Marvis</span> <i>enters, dressed but carrying garments and towels.</i> <span class="smcap">Lois</span> <i>is a year older than</i> <span class="smcap">Julie</span> <i>and is nearly her double in face and voice, but in her clothes and expression are the marks of the conservative. Yes, you’ve guessed it. Mistaken identity is the old rusty pivot upon which the plot turns.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Starting</i>) Oh, ’scuse me. I didn’t know you were here.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Oh, hello. I’m giving a little concert—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Interrupting</i>) Why didn’t you lock the door?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Didn’t I?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Of course you didn’t. Do you think I just walked through it?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> I thought you picked the lock, dearest.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> You’re <i>so</i> careless.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> No. I’m happy as a garbage-man’s dog and I’m giving a little concert.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Severely</i>) Grow up!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Waving a pink arm around the room</i>) The walls reflect the sound, you see. That’s why there’s something very beautiful about singing in a bath-tub. It gives an effect of surpassing loveliness. Can I render you a selection?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> I wish you’d hurry out of the tub.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Shaking her head thoughtfully</i>) Can’t be hurried. This is my kingdom at present, Godliness.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Why the mellow name?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Because you’re next to Cleanliness. Don’t throw anything please!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> How long will you be?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>After some consideration</i>) Not less than fifteen nor more than twenty-five minutes.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> As a favor to me will you make it ten?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Reminiscing</i>) Oh, Godliness, do you remember a day in the chill of last January when one Julie, famous for her Easter-rabbit smile, was going out and there was scarcely any hot water and young Julie had just filled the tub for her own little self when the wicked sister came and did bathe herself therein, forcing the young Julie to perform her ablutions with cold cream—which is expensive and a darn lot of troubles?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Impatiently</i>) Then you won’t hurry?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Why should I?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> I’ve got a date.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Here at the house?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> None of your business.</p>
			<p>(<span class="smcap">Julie</span> <i>shrugs the visible tips of her shoulders and stirs the water into ripples.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> So be it.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Oh, for Heaven’s sake, yes! I have a date here, at the house—in a way.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> In a way?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> He isn’t coming in. He’s calling for me and we’re walking.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Raising her eyebrows</i>) Oh, the plot clears. It’s that literary Mr. Calkins. I thought you promised mother you wouldn’t invite him in.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Desperately</i>) She’s so idiotic. She detests him because he’s just got a divorce. Of course she’s had more experience than I have, but—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Wisely</i>) Don’t let her kid you! Experience is the biggest gold brick in the world. All older people have it for sale.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> I like him. We talk literature.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Oh, so that’s why I’ve noticed all these weighty books around the house lately.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> He lends them to me.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Well, you’ve got to play his game. When in Rome do as the Romans would like to do. But I’m through with books. I’m all educated.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> You’re very inconsistent—last summer you read every day.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> If I were consistent I’d still be living on warm milk out of a bottle.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Yes, and probably my bottle. But I like Mr. Calkins.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> I never met him.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Well, will you hurry up?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Yes. (<i>After a pause</i>) I wait till the water gets tepid and then I let in more hot.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Sarcastically</i>) How interesting!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> ’Member when we used to play “soapo”?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Yes—and ten years old. I’m really quite surprised that you don’t play it still.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> I do. I’m going to in a minute.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Silly game.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Warmly</i>) No, it isn’t. It’s good for the nerves. I’ll bet you’ve forgotten how to play it.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Defiantly</i>) No, I haven’t. You—you get the tub all full of soapsuds and then you get up on the edge and slide down.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Shaking her head scornfully</i>) Huh! That’s only part of it. You’ve got to slide down without touching your hand or feet—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span>(<i>Impatiently</i>) Oh, Lord! What do I care? I wish we’d either stop coming here in the summer or else get a house with two bath-tubs.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> You can buy yourself a little tin one, or use the hose——</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Oh, shut up!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Irrelevantly</i>) Leave the towel.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> What?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Leave the towel when you go.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> This towel?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Sweetly</i>) Yes, I forgot my towel.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Looking around for the first time</i>) Why, you idiot! You haven’t even a kimono.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Also looking around</i>) Why, so I haven’t.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Suspicion growing on her</i>) How did you get here?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) I guess I—I guess I whisked here. You know—a white form whisking down the stairs and—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Scandalized</i>) Why, you little wretch. Haven’t you any pride or self-respect?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Lots of both. I think that proves it. I looked very well. I really am rather cute in my natural state.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Well, you—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Thinking aloud</i>) I wish people didn’t wear any clothes. I guess I ought to have been a pagan or a native or something.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> You’re a—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> I dreamt last night that one Sunday in church a small boy brought in a magnet that attracted cloth. He attracted the clothes right off of everybody; put them in an awful state; people were crying and shrieking and carrying on as if they’d just discovered their skins for the first time. Only <i>I</i> didn’t care. So I just laughed. I had to pass the collection plate because nobody else would.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Who has turned a deaf ear to this speech</i>) Do you mean to tell me that if I hadn’t come you’d have run back to your room—un—unclothed?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> <i>Au naturel</i> is so much nicer.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Suppose there had been some one in the living-room.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> There never has been yet.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> Yet! Good grief! How long—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Besides, I usually have a towel.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Completely overcome</i>) Golly! You ought to be spanked. I hope you get caught. I hope there’s a dozen ministers in the living-room when you come out—and their wives, and their daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> There wouldn’t be room for them in the living-room, answered Clean Kate of the Laundry District.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> All right. You’ve made your own—bath-tub; you can lie in it.</p>
			<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Lois</span> starts determinedly for the door.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>In alarm</i>) Hey! Hey! I don’t care about the k’mono, but I want the towel. I can’t dry myself on a piece of soap and a wet wash-rag.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Obstinately</i>) I won’t humor such a creature. You’ll have to dry yourself the best way you can. You can roll on the floor like the animals do that don’t wear any clothes.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Complacent again</i>) All right. Get out!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>Haughtily</i>) Huh!</p>
			<p>(<span class="smcap">Julie</span> <i>turns on the cold water and with her finger directs a parabolic stream at</i> <span class="smcap">Lois</span>. <span class="smcap">Lois</span> <i>retires quickly, slamming the door after her.</i> <span class="smcap">Julie</span> <i>laughs and turns off the water</i>)</p>

(<i>No answer</i>) I believe you’re a ghost. Are you? (<i>No answer</i>) Well, then, stop banging. (<i>She reaches out and turns on the warm tap. No water flows.

			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Starting up, all ears immediately</i>) Jumping cats!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Helpfully</i>) Water’s no good for fits.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Fits! Who said anything about fits!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> You said something about a cat jumping.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Decidedly</i>) I did not!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Well, we can talk it over later, Are you ready to go out? Or do you still feel that if you go with me just now everybody will gossip?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Smiling</i>) Gossip! Would they? It’d be more than gossip—it’d be a regular scandal.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Here, you’re going it a little strong. Your family might be somewhat disgruntled—but to the pure all things are suggestive. No one else would even give it a thought, except a few old women. Come on.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> You don’t know what you ask.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Do you imagine we’d have a crowd following us?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> A crowd? There’d be a special, all-steel, buffet train leaving New York hourly.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Say, are you house-cleaning?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Why?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> I see all the pictures are off the walls.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Why, we never have pictures in this room.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Odd, I never heard of a room without pictures or tapestry or panelling or something.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> There’s not even any furniture in here.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> What a strange house!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> It depend on the angle you see it from.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Sentimentally</i>) It’s so nice talking to you like this—when you’re merely a voice. I’m rather glad I can’t see you.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie</span>; (<i>Gratefully</i>) So am I.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> What color are you wearing?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>After a critical survey of her shoulders</i>) Why, I guess it’s a sort of pinkish white.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Is it becoming to you?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Very. It’s—it’s old. I’ve had it for a long while.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> I thought you hated old clothes.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> I do but this was a birthday present and I sort of have to wear it.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Pinkish-white. Well I’ll bet it’s divine. Is it in style?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Quite. It’s very simple, standard model.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> What a voice you have! How it echoes! Sometimes I shut my eyes and seem to see you in a far desert island calling for me. And I plunge toward you through the surf, hearing you call as you stand there, water stretching on both sides of you—</p>
			<p>(<i>The soap slips from the side of the tub and splashes in. The young man blinks</i>)</p>
			<p>YOUNG MAN: What was that? Did I dream it?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Yes. You’re—you’re very poetic, aren’t you?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Dreamily</i>) No. I do prose. I do verse only when I am stirred.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Murmuring</i>) Stirred by a spoon—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> I have always loved poetry. I can remember to this day the first poem I ever learned by heart. It was “Evangeline.”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> That’s a fib.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Did I say “Evangeline”? I meant “The Skeleton in Armor.”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> I’m a low-brow. But I can remember my first poem. It had one verse:</p>

			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Eagerly</i>) Are you growing fond of literature?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> If it’s not too ancient or complicated or depressing. Same way with people. I usually like ’em not too ancient or complicated or depressing.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Of course I’ve read enormously. You told me last night that you were very fond of Walter Scott.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Considering</i>) Scott? Let’s see. Yes, I’ve read “Ivanhoe” and “The Last of the Mohicans.”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> That’s by Cooper.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Angrily</i>) “Ivanhoe” is? You’re crazy! I guess I know. I read it.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> “The Last of the Mohicans” is by Cooper.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> What do I care! I like O. Henry. I don’t see how he ever wrote those stories. Most of them he wrote in prison. “The Ballad of Reading Gaol” he made up in prison.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Biting his lip</i>) Literature—literature! How much it has meant to me!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Well, as Gaby Deslys said to Mr. Bergson, with my looks and your brains there’s nothing we couldn’t do.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) You certainly are hard to keep up with. One day you’re awfully pleasant and the next you’re in a mood. If I didn’t understand your temperament so well—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Impatiently</i>) Oh, you’re one of these amateur character-readers, are you? Size people up in five minutes and then look wise whenever they’re mentioned. I hate that sort of thing.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> I don’t boast of sizing you up. You’re most mysterious, I’ll admit.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> There’s only two mysterious people in history.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Who are they?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> The Man with the Iron Mask and the fella who says “ug uh-glug uh-glug uh-glug” when the line is busy.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> You <i>are</i> mysterious. I love you. You’re beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous, and that’s the rarest known combination.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> You’re a historian. Tell me if there are any bath-tubs in history. I think they’ve been frightfully neglected.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Bath-tubs! Let’s see. Well, Agamemnon was stabbed in his bath-tub. And Charlotte Corday stabbed Marat in his bath-tub.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Sighing</i>) Way back there! Nothing new besides the sun, is there? Why only yesterday I picked up a musical-comedy score that must have been at least twenty years old; and there on the cover it said “The Shimmies of Normandy,” but shimmie was spelt the old way, with a “C.”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> I loathe these modern dances. Oh, Lois, I wish I could see you. Come to the window.</p>
			<p>(<i>There is a loud bang in the water-pipe and suddenly the flow starts from the open taps. Julie turns them off quickly</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Puzzled</i>) What on earth was that?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Ingeniously</i>) I heard something, too.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Sounded like running water.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> Didn’t it? Strange like it. As a matter of fact I was filling the gold-fish bowl.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Still puzzled</i>) What was that banging noise?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> One of the fish snapping his golden jaws.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>With sudden resolution</i>) Lois, I love you. I am not a mundane man but I am a forger—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Interested at once</i>) Oh, how fascinating.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span>—a forger ahead. Lois, I want you.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> (<i>Skeptically</i>) Huh! What you really want is for the world to come to attention and stand there till you give “Rest!”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> Lois I—Lois I—</p>
			<p>(<i>He stops as</i> <span class="smcap">Lois</span> <i>opens the door, comes in, and bangs it behind her. She looks peevishly at</i> <span class="smcap">Julie</span> <i>and then suddenly catches sight of the young man in the window</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Lois:</span> (<i>In horror</i>) Mr. Calkins!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>Surprised</i>) Why I thought you said you were wearing pinkish white!</p>
			<p>(<i>After one despairing stare</i> <span class="smcap">Lois</span> <i>shrieks, throws up her hands in surrender, and sinks to the floor.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">The Young Man:</span> (<i>In great alarm</i>) Good Lord! She’s fainted! I’ll be right in.</p>

			<p><span class="smcap">Julie:</span> In that case I’ll be right out.</p>
