			The Quintessence of Quaintness in One Act</h2>
			<p><i>The Scene is the Exterior of a Cottage in West Issacshire on a desperately Arcadian afternoon in August.</i> <span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky</span>, <i>quaintly dressed in the costume of an Elizabethan peasant, is pottering and doddering among the pots and dods. He is an old man, well past the prime of life, no longer young. From the fact that there is a burr in his speech and that he has absentmindedly put on his coat wrongside out, we surmise that he is either above or below the ordinary superficialities of life.</i></p>
			<p><i>Near him on the grass lies</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, <i>a little boy.</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, <i>of course, has his chin on his palm like the pictures of the young Sir Walter Raleigh. He has a complete set of features, including serious, sombre, even funereal, gray eyes⁠—and radiates that alluring air of never having eaten food. This air can best be radiated during the afterglow of a beef dinner. He is looking at</i> <span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky</span>, <i>fascinated.</i></p>
			<p>
				<i>Silence.⁠ ⁠… The song of birds.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> Often at night I sit at my window and regard the stars. Sometimes I think they’re my stars.⁠ ⁠… (<i>Gravely</i>) I think I shall be a star some day.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Whimsically</i>) Yes, yes⁠ ⁠… yes.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> I know them all: Venus, Mars, Neptune, Gloria Swanson.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> I don’t take no stock in astronomy.⁠ ⁠… I’ve been thinking o’ Lunnon, laddie. And calling to mind my daughter, who has gone for to be a typewriter.⁠ ⁠… (<i>He sighs.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> I liked Ulsa, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky; she was so plump, so round, so buxom.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Not worth the paper she was padded with, laddie. (<i>He stumbles over a pile of pots and dods.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> How is your asthma, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Worse, thank God!⁠ ⁠… (<i>Gloomily.)</i> I’m a hundred years old⁠ ⁠… I’m getting brittle.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> I suppose life has been pretty tame since you gave up petty arson.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Yes⁠ ⁠… yes.⁠ ⁠… You see, Peter, laddie, when I was fifty I reformed once⁠—in prison.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> You went wrong again?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Worse than that. The week before my term expired they insisted on transferring to me the glands of a healthy young prisoner they were executing.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> And it renovated you?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Renovated me! It put the Old Nick back into me! This young criminal was evidently a suburban burglar and a kleptomaniac. What was a little playful arson in comparison!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> (<i>Awed</i>) How ghastly! Science is the bunk.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Sighing</i>) I got him pretty well subdued now. ’Tisn’t everyone who has to tire out two sets o’ glands in his lifetime. I wouldn’t take another set for all the animal spirits in an orphan asylum.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> (<i>Considering</i>) I shouldn’t think you’d object to a nice quiet old clergyman’s set.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Clergymen haven’t got glands⁠—they have souls.</p>
			<p>(<i>There is a low, sonorous honking off stage to indicate that a large motorcar has stopped in the immediate vicinity. Then a young man handsomely attired in a dress-suit and a patent-leather silk hat comes onto the stage. He is very mundane. His contrast to the spirituality of the other two is observable as far back as the first row of the balcony. This is</i> <span class="smcap">Rodney Divine.</span>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> I am looking for Ulsa Icky.</p>
			<p>(<span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky</span> <i>rises and stands tremulously between two dods.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> My daughter is in Lunnon.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> She has left London. She is coming here. I have followed her.</p>
			<p>(<i>He reaches into the little mother-of-pearl satchel that hangs at his side for cigarettes. He selects one and scratching a match touches it to the cigarette. The cigarette instantly lights.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> I shall wait.</p>
			<p>(<i>He waits. Several hours pass. There is no sound except an occasional cackle or hiss from the dods as they quarrel among themselves. Several songs can be introduced here or some card tricks by</i> <span class="smcap">Divine</span> <i>or a tumbling act, as desired.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> It’s very quiet here.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Yes, very quiet.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>(<i>Suddenly a loudly dressed girl appears; she is very worldly. It is</i> <span class="smcap">Ulsa Icky</span>. <i>On her is one of those shapeless faces peculiar to early Italian painting.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>In a coarse, worldly voice</i>) Feyther! Here I am! Ulsa did what?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Tremulously</i>) Ulsa, little Ulsa. (<i>They embrace each other’s torsos.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Hopefully</i>) You’ve come back to help with the ploughing.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>Sullenly</i>) No, feyther; ploughing’s such a beyther. I’d reyther not.</p>
			<p>(<i>Though her accent is broad, the content of her speech is sweet and clean.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Conciliatingly</i>) See here, Ulsa. Let’s come to an understanding.</p>
			<p>(<i>He advances toward her with the graceful, even stride that made him captain of the striding team at Cambridge.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> You still say it would be Jack?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> What does she mean?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Kindly</i>) My dear, of course, it would be Jack. It couldn’t be Frank.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Frank who?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> It <i>would</i> be Frank!</p>
			<p>(<i>Some risqué joke can be introduced here.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Whimsically</i>) No good fighting⁠ ⁠… no good fighting⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Reaching out to stroke her arm with the powerful movement that made him stroke of the crew at Oxford</i>) You’d better marry me.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>Scornfully</i>) Why, they wouldn’t let me in through the servants’ entrance of your house.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Angrily</i>) They wouldn’t! Never fear⁠—you shall come in through the mistress’ entrance.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> Sir!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>In confusion</i>) I beg your pardon. You know what I mean?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Aching with whimsey</i>) You want to marry my little Ulsa?⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> I do.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Your record is clean.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> Excellent. I have the best constitution in the world⁠—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> And the worst bylaws.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> At Eton I was a member at Pop; at Rugby I belonged to Near-beer. As a younger son I was destined for the police force⁠—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Skip that.⁠ ⁠… Have you money?⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> Wads of it. I should expect Ulsa to go down town in sections every morning⁠—in two Rolls Royces. I have also a kiddy-car and a converted tank. I have seats at the opera⁠—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>Sullenly</i>) I can’t sleep except in a box. And I’ve heard that you were cashiered from your club.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> A cashier?⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Hanging his head</i>) I was cashiered.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> What for?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Almost inaudibly</i>) I hid the polo balls one day for a joke.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Is your mind in good shape?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Gloomily</i>) Fair. After all what is brilliance? Merely the tact to sow when no one is looking and reap when everyone is.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Be careful.⁠ ⁠… I will not marry my daughter to an epigram.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>More gloomily</i>) I assure you I’m a mere platitude. I often descend to the level of an innate idea.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>Dully</i>) None of what you’re saying matters. I can’t marry a man who thinks it would be Jack. Why Frank would⁠—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Interrupting</i>) Nonsense!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>Emphatically</i>) You’re a fool!</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Tut-tut!⁠ ⁠… One should not judge⁠ ⁠… Charity, my girl. What was it Nero said?⁠—“With malice toward none, with charity toward all⁠—”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> That wasn’t Nero. That was John Drinkwater.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> Come! Who is this Frank? Who is this Jack?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Morosely</i>) Gotch.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> Dempsey.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> We were arguing that if they were deadly enemies and locked in a room together which one would come out alive. Now I claimed that Jack Dempsey would take one⁠—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> (<i>Angrily</i>) Rot! He wouldn’t have a⁠—</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Divine:</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) You win.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> Then I love you again.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> So I’m going to lose my little daughter⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Ulsa:</span> You’ve still got a houseful of children.</p>
			<p>(<span class="smcap">Charles</span>, <span class="smcap">Ulsa’s</span> <i>brother, coming out of the cottage. He is dressed as if to go to sea; a coil of rope is slung about his shoulder and an anchor is hanging from his neck.</i>)</p>

			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Sadly</i>) You went to seed long ago.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Charles:</span> I’ve been reading “Conrad.”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> (<i>Dreamily</i>) “Conrad,” ah! “Two Years Before the Mast,” by Henry James.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Charles:</span> What?</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Peter:</span> Walter Pater’s version of “Robinson Crusoe.”</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Charles:</span> (<i>To his feyther</i>) I can’t stay here and rot with you. I want to live my life. I want to hunt eels.</p>

			<p>(<i>It will be noticed that some of the characters have not spoken for some time. It will improve the technique if they can be rendering a spirited saxophone number.</i>)</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> (<i>Mournfully</i>) These vales, these hills, these McCormick harvesters⁠—they mean nothing to my children. I understand.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Charles:</span> (<i>More gently</i>) Then you’ll think of me kindly, feyther. To understand is to forgive.</p>
			<p><span class="smcap"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Icky:</span> No⁠ ⁠… no.⁠ ⁠… We never forgive those we can understand.⁠ ⁠… We can only forgive those who wound us for no reason at all.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="smcap">Charles:</span> (<i>Impatiently</i>) I’m so beastly sick of your human nature line. And, anyway, I hate the hours around here.</p>
